# Predicting Housing Prices
By **Dustin Stewart**

**This project seeks to use housing data from Ames, Iowa to create a model that will accurately predict housing prices given new housing data.**


## Summary

Through purposefully cleaning our data, analyzing distributions/relationships between variables, and fitting and refining a regression model, we can predict the housing prices in Ames, Iowa within 20,000 dollars on average, which is significantly better than a baseline model could predict.
